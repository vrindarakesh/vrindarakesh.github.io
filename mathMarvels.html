                <h4> 000: Introduction</h4>
                <p>Math!? You might wonder why I used that punctuation. Well, that's what Math was to me until I graduated from college. It was all about equations, a myriad of symbols, and it all looked like an alien language. I never found joy in learning it, except for the satisfaction I felt from successfully memorizing formulas and solving problems.

                    But when did my perspective on Math change? It was when I realized that everything around us is built on numbers. Understanding the world seemed impossible without befriending Math. I realized that something was missing in the way I was taught Math, which made it so daunting. And when my son, just a toddler, began exploring the world of numbers, I was determined that he wouldn't face the same struggles I did. So, I decided to go back to basics.
                    Once I delved into the foundational aspects of Math, I began to appreciate its beauty. It was like discovering missing puzzle pieces and experiencing the satisfaction of putting them together to reveal the bigger picture.
                    
                    Inspired by this newfound love, I decided to document my journey from the very beginning, hoping to inspire others to fall in love with Math just as I have.
                    So, it all began for me with a quest to understand why we created the number system we use today and why it consists of ten symbols.
                    
                    Let's conclude this post with a series of questions to ponder before we delve deeper:
                    
                    Have you ever wondered when humanity first began using numbers? 
                    How did ancient civilizations count before the invention of our modern number system?
                    And why did we settle on ten symbols to represent our numerical system?
                    </p>

                <h4> 001: History of Numerical Systems</h4>
                <p>
                    Ever wondered when humans began counting systematically, with purpose? It's not an easy question to answer.
                    Perhaps our ancestors used fingers, tallies with sticks or pebbles, or marks on stone or clay. Their counting needs might have revolved around their livestock or tracking the passing days.
                    
                    But as civilizations grew, so did the need for a more sophisticated system. They required a way to handle larger quantities and plan for agriculture and trade effectively.
                     Thus, the development of number systems not only helped in keeping track of quantities but also unveiled patterns in the world around us. Different civilizations employed various methods. 
                     The ancient Egyptians, for instance, crafted a complex system using hieroglyphics—a base 10 system.

                      But what exactly is a base? In simple terms, it's the count condensed into a single symbol. 
                      For instance, in the base-10 system, from 0 to 9, we only need one place or digit. Once we reach 10, we move to the next place or digit.
                    Exploring ancient number systems can be fascinating. 
                    Take the Babylonian system, for example, which was base-60 or sexagesimal. Can you wrap your head around a system using just two symbols?

                    Then there are the Greek,

                    <img src="./resources/images/math001Images/greek_numbers_3.gif" alt="greek numerical system">
                    Indian,
                    <img src="./resources/images/math001Images/Indian_num_4.gif" alt="Indian numerical system">

                    Chinese, 
                    <img src="./resources/images/math001Images/oracular.gif" alt="chinese numerical system">

                    each with its own unique quirks and methods.

                    The most prevalent system today is the base-ten, or decimal, system. 
                    Invented by Hindus in ancient India and later refined by Arabs, it consists of 10 digits (0–9) that can represent any number. Each digit's value is determined by its position in the number—a ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and so on.
                    But our exploration doesn't end here. In our next section, we'll dive deeper into the concept of bases and uncover even more fascinating aspects of mathematics. Stay tuned for more adventures in the world of numbers!"
