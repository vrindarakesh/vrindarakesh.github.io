                <h4> 000: Introduction</h4>
                <p>Math!? You might wonder why I used that punctuation. Well, that's what Math was to me until I graduated from college. It was all about equations, a myriad of symbols, and it all looked like an alien language. I never found joy in learning it, except for the satisfaction I felt from successfully memorizing formulas and solving problems.

                    But when did my perspective on Math change? It was when I realized that everything around us is built on numbers. Understanding the world seemed impossible without befriending Math. I realized that something was missing in the way I was taught Math, which made it so daunting. And when my son, just a toddler, began exploring the world of numbers, I was determined that he wouldn't face the same struggles I did. So, I decided to go back to basics.
                    Once I delved into the foundational aspects of Math, I began to appreciate its beauty. It was like discovering missing puzzle pieces and experiencing the satisfaction of putting them together to reveal the bigger picture.
                    
                    Inspired by this newfound love, I decided to document my journey from the very beginning, hoping to inspire others to fall in love with Math just as I have.
                    So, it all began for me with a quest to understand why we created the number system we use today and why it consists of ten symbols.
                    
                    Let's conclude this post with a series of questions to ponder before we delve deeper:
                    
                    Have you ever wondered when humanity first began using numbers? 
                    How did ancient civilizations count before the invention of our modern number system?
                    And why did we settle on ten symbols to represent our numerical system?
                    </p>
