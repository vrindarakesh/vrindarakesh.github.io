Math?! You might wonder why I used that punctuation. Well, that's what Math was to me until I graduated from college. It was all about equations, a myriad of symbols, and it all looked like an alien language. I never found joy in learning it, except for the satisfaction I felt from successfully memorizing formulas and solving problems.

But when did my perspective on Math change?  
It was when I realized that everything around us is built on numbers. Understanding the world seemed impossible without befriending Math. I realized that something was missing in the way I was taught Math, which made it so daunting. And as my son took his first steps into the world of learning, I was determined that he wouldn't face the same struggles I did. So, I decided to go back to the basics.

Once I delved into the foundational aspects of Math, I began to appreciate its beauty. It was like discovering missing puzzle pieces and experiencing the satisfaction of putting them together to reveal the bigger picture. Inspired by this newfound love, I decided to document my journey from the very beginning, hoping to inspire others to fall in love with Math just as I have.

Join me on this journey back to the dawn of mathematics, to understand the fascinating origins of the ten symbols that form the very foundation — and discover why it has stood the test of time.
