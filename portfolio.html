                <h3>SyncNature</h3>
                <p>This work was started with a motive to use it as a template for my blog. Unfortunately the domain was not available
                    and i was more interested in a name related to our tradition and culture, but it still remains as one of my best designs </p>

                <h3>Frontend designer's cheatsheet</h3>
                <p>Inspired by a codeacademy project, i thought of developing a site which might be useful for future design/development references</p>

                <h3>Varnachitram - A painting app for kids</h3>
                <p>This work was actually inspired by my Son. Most coloring apps felt less friendly for a 2 year old. 
                    Either too costly or the free ones have less features and are mostly cluttered. 
                    So i thought it would be a good project for me to play around as well.</p>

                <p>This work was done for the company that i previously worked for. 
                    The first thing that came to my mind was to use 'letter Q' to create an 'Innovation bulb' and finally adding the fire of innovation with 'letter N' inside  </p>
